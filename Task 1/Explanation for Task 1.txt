Task 1A

1) First read and convert the given binary number to decimal
2) Check against the constraints for valid entries
3) Output -1 if entered binary is 0 or negative
4) Find the pairs of number which have the smallest difference and whose average is equal to entered number (i.e the successor and predecessor)
5) Check if the final two numbers have same number of digits (in binary) as the original binary number entered (leading 0's ar allowed in the new numbers)
6) If step 5 is possible print the numbers in ascending in binary or else output -1

Task 1B

1) Take input and check against constraints for valid entries
2) If entered length is 1 output 0, Else go to step 3
3) Use a loop until the length of the string becomes 0
  3.1) Check if first half of string is same as second half; If yes use either half of the string for next iteration
  3.2) Reduce length of the string by 2
  3.3) Increase count by 1
4) Output the number 

Task 1C

1) Take input of strings and add them to an list (or array) 
2) Check against the constraints for valid entries
3) Loop through till number of days
  3.1) Check if there was a workshop on that day; If yes go to step 3.1.1
    3.1.1) Check if team had pizza; If No, go to4
      3.1.1.1) If yes, it was a successful workshop
      3.1.1.2) If no, it was not a successful workshop
4) Multiply the increase amount by number of successful workshops and the decrease amount by number of unsuccessful workshops 
5) Check the net (increase - decrease) 
  5.1) If positive, output "promoted"
  5.2) If negative, output "demoted"
  5.3) If 0, output "no change"
  
Task 1D

1) Take input of the sizes for pattern and add them to list (or array) for ease of reading
2) Loop for all the sizes given in the input list
  2.1) Loop from 0 to half of the current size
    2.1.1) If first line output all stars; Else go to 2.1.2
    2.1.2) Ouptut (current size - nth odd number)/2 stars + nth odd number of white spaces + (current size - nth odd number)/2 stars 
           (Here n is the current row)
  2.2) Loop from half of the current size to 0 
    2.2.1) If first line output all stars; Else go to 2.1.2
    2.2.2) Output (current size - nth odd number)/2 stars + nth odd number of white spaces + (current size - nth odd number)/2 stars 
           (Here n is the current row)
