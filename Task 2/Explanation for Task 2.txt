Task 2A

1) First read the initial number of test cases followed by the bracket strings 
2) Check against the constraints for valid entries
3) Use a loop to iterate through the strings 
  3.1) If the object is an opening bracket add +1 to the sum
  3.2) If the object is a closing bracket add -1 to the sum 
  3.3) If at any point the sum becomes lesser than 0 break the loop 
  3.4) If the sum at any point becomes 0, count takes the value of the index of the bracket where sum became 0
4) Output the count

Task 2B

1) Take the input of length of the array, number of additions to do and the input string for 
2) Check against constraints for valid entries
3) Use a loop to create the basic array of numbers with i+1 value at index i
4) Use a loop to iterate through the addition string
  4.1) make a dummy array of same length as the basic array full of 0s 
  4.2) take the indices mentioned in the addition string 
    4.2.1) Use a loop to add the corresponding value to correct indices to the dummy array
  4.3) Use a loop to add the elements of the dummy array to the basic array
5) Output the max value of the modified basic array 

Task 2C

1) Take input of numbers 
2) Check against the constraints for valid entries
3) Create an array called bad steps with the positions as values
4) Create an array called steps with all the bad steps along with the starting step 0 and final step 'n'
5) Create a nested array called good steps having smaller arrays which consist of the continuous stretches of good steps
6) Declare a variable count and initialise its value to 1
7) Check in the array of bad steps if any two consecutive numbers has a difference of 1 (i.e check if they are consecutive)
  7.1) If yes, output 0 and exit the program
  7.2) If no, go to step 8
8) Iterate through the nested array called goodsteps
  8.1) If the smaller array has a length greater than or equal to 2
    8.1.1) Apply Fibonacci function to the length of this array and multiply it to count
    8.2.2) Modulo count by 1000000007 to make it faster
9) Output count
  
Task 2D

1) Take input of length of array A and then take input of array B 
2) Check against the constraints for valid entries
3) Declare an empty array for the final answer (used as an attempt to get the array A mentioned int he question)
4) Iterate from the end to the beginning of array B
  4.1) If it is the first element being added to the final array
    4.1.1) Add that element to final array
  4.2) Otherwise 
    4.2.1) If the element is lessed than the next element 
      4.2.1.1) Add that element to final array
      4.2.1.2) Else add the next element to final array 
5) Declare a variable sum and iterate through final array and add up all the elements
6) Add the element at index 0 of B to the sum (this is actually the unknown first element of array A since we had iterated from the back of the array)
7) Output the sum
